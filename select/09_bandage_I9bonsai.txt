Give a fuck about a lame
How you look you look the same
Hella odd, you deranged
Make it just to throw away
Didn't you know that you to blame
Couldn't give a fuck bout fame
Make it flip, give me the stage
Can't stand to see it like u maced
Swervin in the v, I could never ever stop
Kickin laid back, bitch I only want the top
You watching from the sidelines, acting like an opp
Bitch you ain't strapped up you be playing cod
Bitch you is a trick ion even wanna fuck
Clean your act up bitch you need to tidy up
Bitch you need your hair did bitch you looking bum
But when you see I get it, why did you ask for some?
I don't need anybody, don't need no coup no Audi
But its getting rowdy, don't need to say sum
Bitch you know all about it, you could tally it up
Bitch I'm up and counting
Your girl always looking at me
I can't blame her though she like what she see
RMC jeans lookin like a fiend
I've been moving fast since a preteen
You ain't jugg nothing but your whole swag
Talk bout sum you ain't got, what's there to brag
Nah they ain't say that about u, nah, nah, who said?
Is it this, or is it that, don't know what you meant
Nah nah nah nah, I won't say shit if bitch jus don't talk to me
Bandage on your leg but you wanna run to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch get off of me
Don't even give a fuck yeah it's a lie to me
When you die you can't take it with you
So I ain't acting like I live for ever what's the issue?
But don't be grieving for me baby baby here's a tissue
And don't be missing me cuz baby baby I can't miss you
Give a fuck about a lame
How you look you look the same
Hella odd, you deranged
Make it just to throw away
Didn't you know that you to blame
Couldn't give a fuck bout fame
Make it flip, give me the stage
Can't stand to see it like u maced
